Greetings!

My name is **Bruno Marques**, and I'm from Porto Alegre in southern Brazil but live in Lisbon since late 2019.

After 9 years working in software development (mostly full-stack, with some backend stints), I decided to shift gears and move to cybersecurity, and now work as an incident
responder for **Siemens CERT**.

Other activities include homebrewing, playing bass, board games and puns of dubious quality.
