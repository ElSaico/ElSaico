Greetings!
==========

My name is **Bruno Marques**, and I'm from Porto Alegre in southern Brazil but live in Lisbon since late 2019.

After 9 years working in software development (mostly full-stack, with some backend stints) and a Master's degree in Computer Science, I decided to shift gears and move to cybersecurity, and now work as an incident responder for **Siemens CERT**.

Other activities include homebrewing, playing bass, board games and puns of dubious quality.

## What have you coded?

Mostly college projects and a bunch of stillborn efforts.

## What are you coding?

Aside from corporate stuff (nothing for public consumption *yet*, but I'm still new at this IR thing), all programming effort these days go to [the broadcasting overlay](https://github.com/ElSaico/comboio-overlay) for [my Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/ElSaico), where I stream some gameplay and the whole "puns of dubious quality" thing *really* shines (~6 months and counting is in the high hundreds!)

This is possible thanks to [NodeCG](https://www.nodecg.dev/), which allows all the flexibility I need.

## What do you plan to code?

Getting more traction in incident handling will allow me to build more tools for automating stuff, and anything not company-specific is going to be released here.

Plus, there's a couple of things on ice that I want to finish someday:

* **A chiptune-to-tab converter** aimed at bass; think FFVI's *Dancing Mad*, for instance. The use of MIDI as an intermediate format (courtesy of [VGMTrans](https://github.com/vgmtrans/vgmtrans)) eliminates a lot of effort, but importing on every software I've found so far relies on a bunch of assumptions that these files don't follow.
* **[Another Flux](https://github.com/ElSaico/AnotherFlux)**, a successor to [Temporal Flux](http://geigercount.net/crypt/) - which remains a cornerstone of the Chrono Trigger modding community despite not having any updates since 2017, thanks to a very flexible plugin architecture that this project aims to support as a drop-in replacement.
  * All the reverse engineering effort required due to its closed-source nature - despite being a .net tool, which makes this far easier - and the leap of faith involved in making the current plugins even *work*, makes me wonder if it's not worth it more to build something from scratch with the available (and rather vast!) ROM documentation.
